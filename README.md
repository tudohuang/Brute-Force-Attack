# 🚀 Brute Force Attack Simulation Project 🔐

## 🎯 What's This All About? 
Welcome to the Brute Force Attack Simulation project! This Python application embarks you on a journey into the world of cryptography, simulating how a brute force attack can crack a four-digit password. Crafted with middle school students in mind, this tool is an interactive and educational way to delve into the foundations of cybersecurity. 

## 🧰 What Do I Need? 
- Python 3.x: Your coding language toolbox.
- Tkinter: Your secret ingredient for building graphical user interfaces. Comes out of the box with Python!

## ⚙️ Setting Up:
- Clone this repository or download the `BruteForceAttack.py` file. It's like getting your treasure map!
- Ensure Python 3.x is installed. That's your compass.

## 🚀 Ready for the Mission?
- Run the `BruteForceAttack.py` file. Let the adventure begin!
- Input your four-digit guess and the integer values of A and B. These are your keys to the puzzle.
- Click the "Perform Attack" button. Watch the simulation come to life!
- If your guess hits the mark, a success message will appear. Congratulations, you've cracked the code! 
- Want to try again? Simply input new values and hit the "Perform Attack" button. 

## 🎁 Sample Mission:
- Input Guess: "1234" (Your secret key)
- Input A Value: "2" (Your first clue)
- Input B Value: "2" (Your second clue)
- Output: "The result is 3412" (You've solved the puzzle!)

## 🔍 Notes:
- Ensure your guess is a four-digit number with no repeating digits and no zero.
- A and B values must be integers.
